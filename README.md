One hand of Poker.

The program:

- creates the deck 
- shuffles the cards 
- creates the user player 
- allows the user to choose the number of artificial players to play against (up to 3)
- allows the user to discard cards (up to 3 cards unlesss an Ace, then 4 cards)
- examines the AI's cards and makes a discard based on the algorithm provided in the project write-up
- re-deals the cards
- examines the outcome of the hand:
  - follows the rules for determining a winner as provided in the project write-up
  - including how to deal with ties, which is different for most types of hands
- declares a winner (or, more unlikely, a tie)


NOTE: if you uncomment the "createHand" line on line 74 in the Game Class and the "createHand" line on line 55 in the Player class, it will allow you to input your own hands.

Both Amber Moore and myself put in a ton of work on this project -- I'd put it at 50/50.  We utilized pair programming methods (she would code while I would pay attention, pointing out syntax errors, giving ideas, taking notes), and the other way around.

I'd like to point out that netiher Amber nor I have any experience in Java (or any object oriented language, for that matter).  As a resut, there are most likely errors that we don't even realize that we are making, so we would appreciate any feedback that we can get.
