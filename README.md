One hand of Poker.

Works about 50% of the time -- it's a problem with the number of players, I think.
It solves a lot of different kinds of hands when it does work, though, and is easy to
play and follow.

Both Amber Moore and myself put in a ton of work on this project -- I'd put it at 50/50.  We utilized pair programming methods (she would code while I would pay attention, pointing out syntax errors, giving ideas, taking notes), and the other way around.

I'd like to point out that neither Amber not I have neither any experience in Java whatsover, nor any experience with object opriented programming.  As a resut, there are most likely errors that we don't even realize that we are making, so we would appreciate any feedback that we can get.
